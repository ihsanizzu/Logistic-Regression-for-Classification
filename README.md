# **Analysis of Factors Affecting the Reluctance to Carry Out COVID-19 PCR Swab Tests on Students Faculty of Science and Mathematics University of Indonesia**

**Abstract**

The PCR swab test is one type of examination for all patients suspected of COVID-19. Until now, the PCR swab test is the most recommended test by WHO to diagnose COVID-19. However, this test has the complexity of the process, and the cost of the equipment is higher, so many people are reluctant to do a COVID-19 swab even though there are already symptoms of being exposed to Covid-19 or prefer other types of examination tests. This research is a case study taken at FMIPA UI. This study aims to analyze the factors that significantly explain the reluctance of FMIPA UI students to carry out PCR swabs if symptoms of being exposed to COVID-19 have appeared. The analytical method used is the method of logistic regression analysis. This study used primary data obtained using the purposive sampling method by distributing online surveys to each departmentâ€™s online groups at FMIPA UI and the respondents involved were active FMIPA UI students. The results obtained are the factors that influence the reluctance to do the PCR Swab test on FMIPA UI students: the level of education of parents, parents' income, and health protocols.
